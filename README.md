# bureaufast

Bureaufast is an open source workflow engine using Vue.js and Mysql with node.js modules.

If prefer, you can pull the docker by command

sudo docker pull bigdecimap/bureaufast:0.9.3

# Git clone then install by npm is also good.


``` bash
## install dependencies
npm install

## serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

Feel free to list your usage here.

Note you need to create a database tt with DB username/password then config it in src/yorm/pool.js.

By docker, currently environment variable for DB configuration is not ready this verion. But will be supported next one.
